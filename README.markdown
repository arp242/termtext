termtext is a Go package to deal with monospace text as interpreted by
terminals.

Mostly intended to nearly align/wrap stuff terminal. There are a few tricky bits
with this:

1. Multiple codepoints can be combined to render one character (or "grapheme
   cluster" in Unicode speak).
2. Some characters are rendered as double-width, such as East-Asian characters
   and some emojis.
3. A single tab can render as multiple spaces, and the number of spaces depends
   on its position in the string.
4. Some characters aren't actually printed to the screen, such as the zero-width
   space and escape sequences to set the colour.

[uniseg] takes care of the first point, [go-runewidth] of the second, and this
package of the third and fourth.

The main function is `Width()`; for example:

    Width("\ta")                â†’ 9    Tab expands to 8 spaces, followed by a.
    Width("a\t")                â†’ 8    Tab expands to 7 spaces.
	Width("ðŸ§‘\tðŸ§‘")             â†’ 10   ðŸ§‘ is double-width
    Width("\x1b[1mbold\x1b[0m") â†’ 4    Escape sequences are ignored.

You can configure the tab width by setting `termtext.TabWidth`.

There are a few auxiliary functions:

    Expand()            Expand tabs.
    Slice()             Slice a string by display width, like str[n:m].

    AlignLeft()         Align a string, filling up the remainder with spaces.
    AlignRight()
    AlignCenter()

    Wrap()              Wrap a string, this is a simple wrap which just breaks
                        if a line is more than w characters.
    WordWrap()          Word-wrap a string: lines are at most w characters, but
                        don't break in the middle of words.
